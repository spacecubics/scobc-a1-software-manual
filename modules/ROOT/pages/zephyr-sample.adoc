== Try Sample Applications on SC-OBC Module A1
Zephyr provides many so-called *sample applications*. The Zephyr documentation has a dedicated page called *Samples and Demos*. +
In this section, we'll build a few samples from Zephyr and run them on your SC-OBC Module A1. +

On the Samples and Demos page, you can interactively search samples. There are over 500 samples in Zephyr v4.1. +
Using the web interface is much easier than checking each sample's README.rst.

If you haven't created your workspace yet, go back to the previous section and do so. +
In this section, we assume you have already set up your development environment and are ready to proceed.

=== Blinky sample
The first sample is *Blinky*. This application blinks an LED on your Development Board.

CAUTION: For the *Blinky* sample, make sure that SW1[10] (LED control) is turned ON.
If it is OFF, the LED will not blink.

==== Build

[source, bash]
----
cd ~/myproject
python3 -m venv ~/zephyrproject/.venv
west build -p always -b scobc_a1 --shield scobc_a1_dev zephyr/samples/basic/blinky
----

This should build your first application, Blinky.

These steps match the *Build the Blinky Sample* section in the Zephyr documentation.

==== Flash

Next, we'll flash the SC-OBC Module A1:

[source, bash]
----
west flash
----

==== Confirm
After flashing, power-cycle the SC-OBC Module A1. You should see the blinking LED (_LED11_).

=== Hello World sample
Next is the ever-popular *Hello World* sample. Before running Hello World, we need to set up the serial connection so the module can send output to your PC.

==== Open Console

Connect the cable between your SC-OBC Module A1 and your PC, then open the console on terminal:

[source, bash]
----
tio /dev/ttyUSB2
----

CAUTION: To use the Zephyr console, bit3 (RX) and bit4 (TX) of DIP Switch (_SW1_) must be turned ON. If they are currently OFF, please switch them ON.

==== Build

Then open the another terminal, and build the sample.

[source, bash]
----
cd ~/myproject
python3 -m venv ~/zephyrproject/.venv
west build -p always -b scobc_a1 --shield scobc_a1_dev zephyr/samples/hello_world
----

==== Flash

Next, we'll flash the SC-OBC Module A1:

[source, bash]
----
west flash
----

==== Confirm
After power-cycle the SC-OBC Module A1, you should see the Hello World string on your serial console.
If you want to exit the tio console, first press `Ctrl + t`, followed by `q`.
