== Setup the Development Environment

=== Prepare the Software

==== Target Platform

This document is focused on *Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64* systems.

You can use any of the following setups:

* A PC with Ubuntu installed
* A system container (e.g., Incus)
* A virtual machine (e.g., QEMU, VirtualBox, VMware)
* Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) (see TIP)

:zephyr-getting-started: https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html

For Windows or macOS users, refer to {zephyr-getting-started}[the upstream Zephyr Getting Started Guide].

:zephyr-install-dependencies: https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html#install-dependencies

[TIP]
====
According to {zephyr-install-dependencies}[the Install dependencies section on the upstream Zephyr Getting Started Guide],
firmware flashing from WSL is not supported. However, for the SC-OBC Module A1 Development Board,
we have confirmed that flashing is possible on WSL2. Detailed instructions for WSL2 user are provided
in the <<Connect the Hardware>> section.

==== Install Required Dependencies
NOTE: This section is mostly the same as Zephyr official documentation.

===== Update your system

[source,  console]
----
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
----

===== Install dependencies

[source,  console]
----
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends git cmake ninja-build gperf \
  ccache dfu-util device-tree-compiler wget \
  python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-tk python3-wheel xz-utils file \
  make gcc gcc-multilib g++-multilib libsdl2-dev libmagic1
----

==== Get Zephyr and Python Requirements

===== Create your working directory

[source, console]
----
mkdir -p ~/myproject && cd ~/myproject
----

===== Install the Python venv package

[source, console]
----
sudo apt install python3-venv
----

===== Create a new virtual environment

[source, console]
----
python3 -m venv ~/myproject/.venv
----

===== Activate the virtual environment

[source, console]
----
source ~/myproject/.venv/bin/activate
----

===== Install the west

[source, console]
----
pip install west
----

===== Clone the SC-OBC Module A1 sample repository using west

[source, console]
----
cd ~/myproject
west init -m https://github.com/spacecubics/scobc-a1-sample
west update
west zephyr-export
----

===== Install the Python requirements

[source, console]
----
west packages pip --install
----

==== Install the Zephyr SDK

[source, console]
----
west sdk install
----

==== Install udev rules

Install the udev rules, which allow you to flash most Zephyr boards as a regular user.

[source, console]
----
sudo cp ~/zephyr-sdk-[VERSION]/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/share/openocd/contrib/60-openocd.rules \
        /etc/udev/rules.d
sudo udevadm control --reload
----

==== Install the OpenOCD related package

Install the packages required for flashing via *OpenOCD*.

[source, console]
----
sudo apt install libftdi1 libgpiod2 libhidapi-hidraw0 libcapstone4
----

==== Install the tio package

Although there are several tools available for working with a serial console, this document uses *tio*.

[source, console]
----
sudo apt install tio
----

=== Connect the Hardware

Before starting development, make sure you have the following components:

* ✔️ SC-OBC Module A1
* ✔️ SC-OBC Module A1 Development Board
* ✔️ USB Micro-B Cable
* ✔️ AC Adapter (5V/3.0A PL03B)

Refer to _SC-OBC Module A1 Development Board Product Manual_ for detailed instructions on how to make the connection.

NOTE: This document does not require a connection between the *MPLAB PICkit* and the *Platform Cable USB II*.

==== For WSL2 User
CON2 on the SC-OBC Module A1 Development Board is the USB Micro-B DEBUG interface and is connected
to the onboard FT4232H USB interface. It provides FPGA JTAG, CPU JTAG, FPGA UART, and TRCH UART. +

When CON2 is connected to your Windows PC, you need to attach it to WSL2 according to
{wsl-usb-connect}[the Microsoft USB connection guide]. +

To attach the device to WSL2, run `usbipd list` on Windows and identify the FTDI multi-port USB
device for CON2 (VID:PID 0403:6011). You need the `BUSID` from this output for the `usbipd bind` and
`usbipd attach` command. The device name may be truncated in the DEVICE column, but the VID:PID
(0403:6011) is sufficient to identify it. +

Example (`BUSID` may differ on your system): +

[source, console]
----
PS C:\Users\user> usbipd list
Connected:
BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                                        STATE
...
9-1    0403:6011  USB Serial Converter A, USB Serial Converter B, USB Seria...  Not shared
----

Attach the device to WSL2 using the `BUSID` shown by `usbipd list`: +

[source, console]
----
usbipd bind --busid 9-1
usbipd attach --wsl --busid 9-1
----

After attaching, the serial ports appear in WSL2 as `/dev/ttyUSB*`.

NOTE: We have confirmed that the `west flash` command takes longer to complete on WSL2 compared
to native Linux. (65 KBytes writing: WSL2 - about 1 minute / Native Linux – about 20 seconds)

=== Check the DIP Switch status

CAUTION: To use the Zephyr console, bit3 (RX) and bit4 (TX) of DIP Switch (_SW1_) must be turned ON. If they are currently OFF, please switch them ON.

=== Power ON the SC-OBC Module A1 Development Board

Once all connections and checks have been completed, switch ON the power switch (_SW2_) on the Development Board to apply power.
