== Try developing applications on SC-OBC Module A1

=== Introduction

This section explains how to develop applications using Zephyr's *T2 topology*. +
Several sample applications are provided to help explain the source code structure, build process, and other development practices.

=== What is T2 topology

Details of the T2 topology can be found in https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/workspaces.html#t2-star-topology-application-is-the-manifest-repository[T2 topology], but it has the following characteristics:

 * Applications can be managed in a dedicated (custom) repository
 * Zephyr and other projects can be managed as sub modules
 * Zephyr drivers can be managed out-of-tree in a dedicated (custom) repository

=== Hello World sample

This section provides an example of building and running the simplest Hello World application within a T2 topology-based repository. +
The sample application is available in https://github.com/spacecubics/scobc-a1-sample/tree/main/samples/hello_world[Hello World sample].

==== Explain the sample code

===== Directory name

The directory name and structure for the sample application can be chosen freely. +
In this example, we use the directory name `sample/hello_world`.

===== CMakefile.txt

A `CMakeLists.txt` file must be placed directly under the application directory.

project(hello-world)

target_sources(app PRIVATE src/main.c)
----

Here, the parts that need to be modified for each application are explained.

 * *project*: Specify the desired project name
 * *target_sources*: Specify the source code file(s)

===== prj.conf

Additional *Kconfig* parameters required for running the application can be specified. +
For this Hello World application, no additional parameters are required, so leaving it empty is fine.

[source, bash]
----
# nothing here
----

===== Source code

The source code is equivalent to the sample code provided by Zephyr, but the displayed parameters have been modified. +
In the Zephyr sample code, `CONFIG_BOARD_TARGET` was displayed, but in this sample, the board name (`CONFIG_BOARD`) and the revision (`CONFIG_BOARD_REVISION`) are displayed separately.

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	printf("Hello World! %s Rev %s\n", CONFIG_BOARD, CONFIG_BOARD_REVISION);

	return 0;
}
----

TIP: The variable names starting with `CONFIG_` store parameters specified in Zephyr's Kconfig. To know all the Kconfig parameters, you can refer to the `~/myproject/build/zephyr/zephyr.dts` file.

==== Open console

Connect the cable between your SC-OBC Module A1 and your PC, then open the console on terminal:

[source, bash]
----
tio /dev/ttyUSB0
----

==== Build

Specify the sample application directory where `CMakeLists.txt` and `prj.conf` are placed, and then build as shown below.

[source, bash]
----
cd ~/myproject
python3 -m venv ~/zephyrproject/.venv
west build -p always -b scobc_a1 --shield scobc_a1_dev scobc-a1-sample/samples/hello_world
----

==== Flash

Next, we'll flash the SC-OBC Module A1:

[source, bash]
----
west flash
----

==== Confirm

After power-cycle the SC-OBC Module A1, you should see the "Hello World" string on the console along with the board name and revision.

[source, bash]
----
*** Booting Zephyr OS build 60e8eb54f7ae ***
Hello World! scobc_a1 Rev 2.0.0
----

If you want to exit the tio console, first press `Ctrl + t`, followed by `q`.

=== System Monitor sample

This section provides an example of building and running the *System Monitor* application within a T2 topology-based repository.

==== What is the System Monitor

Details of the System Monitor can be found in https://sc-obc-fpga-technical-reference-manual.readthedocs.io/ja/latest/#org393e82c[System Monitor], but it has the following characteristics:

FPGA Watchdog::

The system of the SC-OBC Module A1 is monitored by the *TRCH* (Timing, Reset, Config & Health Controller), and the FPGA reports its internal status to the TRCH via the watchdog signal.

NOTE: the Monitoring by TRCH is disabled by default, so using the FPGA Watchdog feature is not mandatory.

SEM Controller::

The *SEM (Soft Error Mitigation) Controller* is a solution provided by _AMD_ for detecting and correcting errors that occur in the configuration memory of AMD FPGAs. +
The SC-OBC Module A1 FPGA integrates this functionality into the system and provides access to the SEM Controller's status through the System Monitor registers.

Board Health Monitor (BHM)::

The *Board Health Monitor (BHM)* is a feature that enables easy retrieval of data from sensors mounted on the SC-OBC Module A1. +
The OBC module is equipped with two current and voltage monitors and three temperature sensors. +
The BHM allows automatic data acquisition from these sensors without requiring complex *I2C* operations in software.

===== System Monitor driver

Currently, the following Zephyr driver APIs are provided for controlling the FPGA's System Monitor.

Enable the System Monitor by FPGA _BHM_. If a non-zero value is returned, sensor initialization has failed.
