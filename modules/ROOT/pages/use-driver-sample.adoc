== Try applications development using Zephyr Driver

=== Introduction

This section explains how to develop applications using Zephyr Driver. +
Several sample applications are provided to explain how to check the Device Tree and how to use drivers.

=== GPIO Driver sample

Using this *GPIO* driver, the LED on the Development Board will blink.
The sample application is available in https://github.com/spacecubics/scobc-a1-sample/tree/main/samples/blinky[Blinky sample].

==== Explain the sample code

===== Directory Name

The directory name and structure for the sample application can be chosen freely. +
In this example, we use the directory name `sample/blinky`.

===== CMakefile.txt

A `CMakeLists.txt` file must be placed directly under the application directory.

 * *project*: Specify the desired project name
 * *target_sources*: Specify the source code file(s)

===== prj.conf

Additional _Kconfig_ parameters required for running the application can be specified. +
As this example uses GPIO, it is necessary to set `CONFIG_GPIO=y`.

			printf("Failed to toggle a GPIO pin (%d)\n", ret);
			return -1;
		}

		led_state = !led_state;
		printf("LED state: %s\n", led_state ? "ON" : "OFF");

	}

	return 0;
}

====== GPIO Device structure

The SC-OBC Module A1 is equipped with AMD (formerly Xilinx)'s AXI GPIO IP core, which connects to 10 GPIOs. +
The relationship between the GPIOs and the User IO pins is as follows, with `GPIO15` connected to the _LED11_on the Development Board.

.GPIO pins List
[options="header"]
|=======================
|User IO pin name|GPIO name in AMD GPIO IP core
|UIO2_15|GPIO15
|UIO2_14|GPIO14
|UIO2_13|GPIO13
|UIO2_12|GPIO12
|UIO2_11|GPIO11
|UIO2_10|GPIO10
|UIO2_09|GPIO9
|UIO2_08|GPIO8
|UIO2_07|GPIO7
|UIO2_06|GPIO6
|=======================

Referring to the https://github.com/spacecubics/scobc-a1-sample/blob/main/boards/shields/scobc_a1_dev/scobc_a1_dev.overlay[DTS overlay file for Development Board], it can be seen that `GPIO15` of the GPIO IP core is defined with the device name `user_led_0`. +
Additionally, an `led0` is assigned using the alias, which is used by Zephyr's blinky sample. However, this alias is not mandatory.

[source, c]
----
	aliases {
		led0 = &user_led_0;
		sw0 = &user_sw_0;
	};

	leds {
		compatible = "gpio-leds";
		user_led_0: led_0 {
			gpios = <&gpio0 15 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		};
	};
----

Therefore, in this example, the GPIO device structure is obtained using `GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET` and `DT_ALIAS`.

[source, c]
----
	const struct gpio_dt_spec led = GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET(DT_ALIAS(led0), gpios);
----

====== Validate that GPIO port is ready

Validate that GPIO port is ready. If the GPIO device is not properly initialized, it will return `false`.

[source, c]
----
	if (!gpio_is_ready_dt(&led)) {
		printf("GPIO device is not ready\n");
		return -1;
	}
----

====== Configure a GPIO pin

The GPIO is configured to its initial state as `OUTPUT_ACTIVE`. If the configuration fails, a non-zero value will be returned.

[source, c]
----
	ret = gpio_pin_configure_dt(&led, GPIO_OUTPUT_ACTIVE);
	if (ret < 0) {
		printf("Failed to configure a GPIO pin (%d)\n", ret);
		return -1;
	}
----

====== Toggle a GPIO pin

Toggle the GPIO pin. If the toggle fails, a non-zero value will be returned.

[source, c]
----
	ret = gpio_pin_toggle_dt(&led);
	if (ret < 0) {
		printf("Failed to toggle a GPIO pin (%d)\n", ret);
		return -1;
	}
----

==== Open console

Connect the cable between your SC-OBC Module A1 and your PC, then open the console on terminal:

[source, bash]
----
tio /dev/ttyUSB0
----

CAUTION: To use the Zephyr console, bit3 (TX) and bit4 (RX) of DIP Switch (_SW1_) must be turned ON. If they are currently OFF, please switch them ON.

==== Build

Specify the sample application directory where `CMakeLists.txt` and `prj.conf` are placed, and then build as shown below.

[source, bash]
----
cd ~/myproject
python3 -m venv ~/zephyrproject/.venv
west build -p always -b scobc_a1 --shield scobc_a1_dev scobc-a1-sample/samples/blinky
----

==== Flash

Next, we'll flash the SC-OBC Module A1:

[source, bash]
----
west flash
----

==== Confirm

After power-cycle the SC-OBC Module A1, you should see that the _LED11_ will blink on and off every second, and the LED state will be displayed on the console.

[source, bash]
----
*** Booting Zephyr OS build 60e8eb54f7ae ***
LED state: OFF
LED state: ON
LED state: OFF
LED state: ON
----

If you want to exit the tio console, first press `Ctrl + t`, followed by `q`.

=== I2C Driver sample

Using the *I2C* driver for the SC-OBC Module A1, this application gets a temperature data from the sensor on the _Development Board_ and displays it on the console.
The sample application is available in https://github.com/spacecubics/scobc-a1-sample/tree/main/samples/i2c[I2C sample].

==== Explain the sample code

===== Directory Name

The directory name and structure for the sample application can be chosen freely. +
In this example, we use the directory name `sample/i2c`.

===== CMakefile.txt

A `CMakeLists.txt` file must be placed directly under the application directory.

Here, the parts that need to be modified for each application are explained.

 * *project*: Specify the desired project name
 * *target_sources*: Specify the source code file(s)

===== prj.conf

Additional Kconfig parameters required for running the application can be specified. +
As this example uses I2C, it is necessary to set `CONFIG_I2C=y`. +
And, to display temperature data of type float using printf, it is necessary to enable `CONFIG_PICOLIBC_IO_FLOAT`. +
For more information about `CONFIG_PICOLIBC_IO_FLOAT`, refer to https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/kconfig.html#CONFIG_PICOLIBC_IO_FLOAT[CONFIG_PICOLIBC_IO_FLOAT].

int main(void)
{
	int ret;
	uint8_t data[2];
	float temp;

	const struct device *i2c = DEVICE_DT_GET(DT_NODELABEL(i2c0));

	printf("Temperature: %.4f [deg]\n", (double)temp);

end:
	return ret;
}
----

====== Device structure

To use the I2C driver API, it is necessary to obtain the corresponding device structure. +
There are several APIs available for retrieving a device structure, but in this sample, `DEVICE_DT_GET` and `DT_NODELABEL` are used. +
The label name specified in `DT_NODELABEL` must match the label defined in the DTS file.
The I2C device connected to the temperature sensor on the Development Board is defined in https://github.com/spacecubics/scobc-a1-sample/blob/main/boards/shields/scobc_a1_dev/scobc_a1_dev.overlay[DTS overlay file for Development Board].

Although tree FPGA I2C cores are available on the Development Board, the temperature sensor is connected to `i2c0`.

[source, c]
----
	const struct device *i2c = DEVICE_DT_GET(DT_NODELABEL(i2c0));
----

TIP: Because the DTS file may be defined across multiple sources via overlays, you may want to inspect the final merged DTS. +
This merged DTS is available in the following file under the build directory. +
 +
`~/myproject/build/zephyr/zephyr.dts`

====== Validate that I2C device is ready

Validate that I2C device is ready. If the I2C device is not properly initialized, it will return `false`.

[source, c]
----
	if (!device_is_ready(i2c)) {
		printf("I2C device is not ready\n");
		ret = -1;
		goto end;
	}
----

====== I2C driver API

The APIs provided by the I2C driver are documented in the I2C interface. +
In this example, it is necessary to read 2 bytes of temperature data from the sensor, so the `i2c_burst_read` API is used to perform a multi-byte read from the I2C device. +
The second argument specifies the slave address of the I2C device. For the *TMP175* temperature sensor used in this example, the slave address is set to `0x4B`. +
The third argument specifies the register address from which the temperature data will be read.
This register address must be obtained from the TMP175 datasheet.
For TMP175, the temperature register address is `0x00`.

[source, c]
----
	ret = i2c_burst_read(i2c, TMP175_I2C_ADDR, TMP175_TEMP_REG, data, ARRAY_SIZE(data));
----

====== Calculate temperature data

The TMP175 temperature data is represented in 12 bits, and its resolution is `0.0625`. Therefore, the raw value is converted before being printed to the console. +
For more details, please refer to the TMP175 datasheet.

[source, c]
----
	data[1] = data[1] >> 4;
	temp = (int8_t)data[0] + (float)data[1] * 0.0625f;
----

=== Check the DIP Switch status

CAUTION: To access the temperature sensor on the Development Board, bit5 (SCL) and bit6 (SDA) of DIP Switch (_SW1_) must be turned ON. If they are currently OFF, please switch them ON.

==== Open console

Connect the cable between your SC-OBC Module A1 and your PC, then open the console on terminal:

[source, bash]
----
tio /dev/ttyUSB0
----

CAUTION: To use the Zephyr console, bit3 (TX) and bit4 (RX) of DIP Switch (_SW1_) must be turned ON. If they are currently OFF, please switch them ON.

==== Build

Specify the sample application directory where `CMakeLists.txt` and `prj.conf` are placed, and then build as shown below.

[source, bash]
----
cd ~/myproject
python3 -m venv ~/zephyrproject/.venv
west build -p always -b scobc_a1 --shield scobc_a1_dev scobc-a1-sample/samples/i2c
----

==== Flash

Next, we'll flash the SC-OBC Module A1:

[source, bash]
----
west flash
----

==== Confirm

After power-cycle the SC-OBC Module A1, you should see the temperature data retrieved from the sensor is displayed on the serial console.

[source, bash]
